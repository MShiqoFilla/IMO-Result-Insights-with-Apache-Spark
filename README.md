# IMO Result Insights with Apache Spark

The goal of this project is to get some insights or information of the all time results of International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) from some favorite countries (in this case: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Romania, Russia, Thailand, United States) by doing some queries using PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark. This project is also aimed to showcase my familiarity in using data processing tool, in this case PySpark in order to solve some analytical and data engineering problems.
